## Welcome to Rose's Lab 6
In this lab we created a digital library


### Classes
In this lab we created a digital library by creating two classes in JavaScript.: book class and library class. We tested the book class by creating a book using code given in lab. We then followed the same process for library class. After this, we added two more books to the library by updating the code. The last thing we did was add an isbn property to delete a book from the library.
